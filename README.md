# Coffee Machine Simulator

This project simulates a digital coffee machine interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a fun and interactive way to explore how a coffee vending machine might work.

## Features

- Interactive menu with three coffee options: Espresso, Latte, and Cappuccino
- Coin insertion simulation
- Real-time display of inserted money
- Coffee selection and preparation
- Resource management (water, milk, coffee beans)
- Change calculation and return
- Machine status report

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML structure of the coffee machine interface
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing the logic for the coffee machine operations
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the interface

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to start the coffee machine simulator.
3. Insert virtual coins by entering amounts in the coin input fields.
4. Select your desired coffee type.
5. The machine will check if you've inserted enough money and if there are sufficient resources.
6. If successful, you'll receive your virtual coffee and any change due.
7. You can view the machine's resource status by clicking the "Show Report" button.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the `MENU` object in `script.js` to add new coffee types or change the existing ones. You can also adjust the initial `resources` to simulate different machine states.

Contributions to improve the coffee machine simulator are welcome. Please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue for any bugs or feature suggestions.
